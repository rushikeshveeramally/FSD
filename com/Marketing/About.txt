Hi This is rushikesh , I am a full stack java developer with over  10years of professional experience.
Throughout my career, I have worked on a wide range of projects, including financial systems, and enterprise applications. I had the opportunity to collaborate with cross-functional teams and deliver high-quality software solutions .

I have extensive experience with Java EE and Spring frameworks, including Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data JPA. I am also well-versed in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular libraries such as Angular and React and for deployment used ci/cd and some version controlling kike GIT and TFS. I take pride in delivering scalable and robust solutions.
